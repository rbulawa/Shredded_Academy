# Shredded_Academy
The idea was to re-design an old looking landing page, and then code it - with a concept of using as little @media queries as possible. 
But to keep the LP responsive and flexible.

Old version - bodyalchemy.me 
New version - https://shreddedacademy.netlify.app/  

It is a personal project.
